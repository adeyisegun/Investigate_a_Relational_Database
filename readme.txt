Overview
In this project, we will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. we will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of this project, we will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the queries.

In this project, we will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, we will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided.

(Note: One quirk you may notice as you explore this database is that the rental dates are all from 2005 and 2006, while the payment dates are all from 2007. Don't worry about this. )
